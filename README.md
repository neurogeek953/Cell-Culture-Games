# Cell-Culture-Games
A virtual experiment involving a biological network of neurons controlling a heater. (Also known as Liquid-State-Machines)
It is powered by the Nengo Spiking Neural Network Simulator.
Run from World.py for the Analog heater or Experiment2.py for the Digital heater.
Note you may need a lot of computer power. I recommend using high-performance-computing services.
Enjoy! Please give me some feedback!
